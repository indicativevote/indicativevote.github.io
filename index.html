<h3>Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU.</h3>
<p>The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is &#39;the will of the people&#39;. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People&#39;s Vote may not happen - so vote now.

<h3>Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019.</h3>
<p>We are wasting Billions of pounds of taxpayers money trying to negotiate in a short space of time. Leaving the EU in March 2019 will allow the UK good time to negotiate more efficiently. The EU will be more eager to accept a deal on our terms having lost a major partner.

<h3>Revoke Art.50 if there is no Brexit plan by the 25 of February</h3>
<p>On the 25th of November both the UK Government and the European Union came to an agreement on the proposed departure from the EU. After an historic defeat in the House of Commons on the 15th of January, 2019 by a majority of 230 votes the PM has now decided to go back to the EU over the backstop.

<h2><span>2nd Referendum</span> <span class="signatures_235138">146,542</span></h2>
<h3>Hold a second referendum on EU membership.</h3>
<p>The Brexit process has been a failure. At the end of two years, our ruling party is bitterly divided, the main opposition not a viable replacement for it, and the deal we have negotiated is almost universally opposed. 
 No one voted for this to happen.

<h3>Grant a People&#39;s Vote if Parliament rejects the EU Withdrawal Agreement</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister has negotiated an EU withdrawal agreement. However, it is clear from resignations and interviews that the deal will not pass Parliament. As no credible alternative has been proposed, the public must be allowed to vote on whether to accept this deal or to remain in the EU.

<h3>UK adopt a Norway style Brexit. Being in the EFTA-EEA. No jurisdiction for UK.</h3>
<p>The Norway model includes two European organizations.The European Free Trade Association(EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA)
UK would leave the EU, join EFTA, and become a full member of the EEA.

<h3>HM Government must ensure that UK can unilaterally withdraw from Brexit backstop</h3>
<p>As a truly sovereign nation, HM Government must ensure that the UK can unilaterally withdraw from the Brexit backstop arrangement as described in the Draft Withdrawal Agreement of the UK from the EU. Otherwise the sovereignty of the UK could be lost forever.

<h3>Hard Remain: Align with other EU countries and adopt Schengen and the euro.</h3>
<p>Many people are unhappy with the various varieties of brexit that are on the table. But many are also unhappy with the current membership of the EU. Another option would be for a &quot;hard remain&quot;. The UK should become part of the Schengen area, adopt the euro currency, and adopt EU driving standards.
