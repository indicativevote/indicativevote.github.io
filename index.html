<h1>Public Indicative Votes</h1>
<p>Petitions representing suitable indicative votes for parliament to consider

<h2>Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU.</h2>
<p>The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now.

<h2>Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019.</h2>
<p>We are wasting Billions of pounds of taxpayers money trying to negotiate in a short space of time. Leaving the EU in March 2019 will allow the UK good time to negotiate more efficiently. The EU will be more eager to accept a deal on our terms having lost a major partner.
