<p class="p-content">We are wasting Billions of pounds of taxpayers money trying to negotiate in a short space of time. Leaving the EU in March 2019 will allow the UK good time to negotiate more efficiently. The EU will be more eager to accept a deal on our terms having lost a major partner.

Despite the best efforts of the political classes and media establishment the &quot;silent majority&quot; still wish to leave the EU. 
If Mrs May&#39;s deal is rejected again we should leave the EU on April 12 with No deal.

<p class="p-content">The Prime Minister has negotiated an EU withdrawal agreement. However, it is clear from resignations and interviews that the deal will not pass Parliament.

<p class="p-content">Many people are unhappy with the various varieties of brexit that are on the table. But many are also unhappy with the current membership of the EU. Another option would be for a &quot;hard remain&quot;. The UK should become part of the Schengen area, adopt the euro currency, and adopt EU driving standards.
